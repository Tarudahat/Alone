   - Islands:
     Design islands:
        5 default Islands
        3 Volcano islands
        1 final island -> has small island which wil be eaten first, thus prime placement location for the bomb
   - fireball enemies
      - fall from sky on volcano island
   -Raft
    -Need for go next Island
    -cost wood + time (1min?)
    -dodge mini game -> wood + or lose more
  -Materials
    -shells E collect -> 3 for 1 KNO3
    -Phosphor on lava island -> dodge falling lava balls
  -Time limit for each Island 3 min?
  -Big monster
    -kill with bomb made
      -depending on # black powder diff ending? like still died, gg, u nuked everything
      - bomb unit: unrealistic composition for balancing reasons
        - bomb unit = 6 coal + 2 sulfur + 2 KNO3 
      - 1 - 3 = still died = max 18 coal + 3 sulfur + 6 KNO = 18 shells
      - 4 - 5 = gg = max 30 coal + 10 sulfur + 10 KNO = 30 shells
      - 5+    = u nuked everything :)
